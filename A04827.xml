            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing finiſhed the tranſlation of this volume, (Right Honorable) I was in doubt whether I might ſafely ſend it forth as a matter that would, as it ought to be imbraced &amp; fauored of eueryone into whoſe hands it ſhould come: or to offer it to the view of ſome honorable perſon, and to commend it to his fauourable protection, and in his name to publiſh it. If I had reſolued vpon the firſt way, as I doubt not but it ſhould haue found many friends, euen all the louers of the trueth, that would gladly haue accepted it: ſo I know it ſhould haue had many aduerſaries among vs in this land, as it hath had in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries alreadie, and commeth now abroad in our owne tongue, from thence greatly reproched, and withſtood with a ſpitefull enemie, albeit to his ſhamefull foyle, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace in the end. And therefore I thought it beſt to follow mine author, as he offereth the knowledge and cuſtodie of the trueth, which he here maintaineth vnto a high and mightie Prince: ſo I am bold to offer my tranſlation of ſo worthie a worke, vnto your honorable protection and defence, againſt

euill tongues and erronious ſpirits. The cauſe that is handled here is Gods; the ground that it hath, is the trueth of his holy word; the witneſſe and teſtimonie thereof, is the vniforme conſent of the Church of Chriſt, beleeuing and confeſſing the ſame; the matter hereof is the redemption of our ſoules, the comfort of our conſciences, the ſtay of our faith, and the anchor of our hope. If the certaintie of theſe things (right Honourable) be called in queſtion, and taken from vs that are mortall men, what ioy can we haue in any thing, that here for a time wee enioy? What hope can wee haue of a better life, when this fraile one ſhall be taken from vs, and wee all ſhall be called to giue our account? But as Satan the enemie of our ſaluation, hath alwaies heretofore ſowed tares among the wheate, and corrupted the ſinceritie of the trueth with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and lyes, and that vnder a faire pretence: ſo at this day, when he could not effect his purpoſe ſo farre as he deſired, by the late and lamentable ſtrife that he hath raiſed among vs, (though thereby he hath quenched the zeale of many, and made them fall from their firſt loue) hath euen now in our Church, as he hath done in others, raiſed a doubt, and bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hed a controuerſie in the maine grounds of our Religion and faith, to wit, in the doctrine of mans Redemption by the death of Chriſt, and of Gods eternall predeſtination. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as he doth not greatly preuaile, becauſe the gouernours of our Church and the conſent of all that bee godly and learned for the moſt part, therein are againſt him: ſo, that hee may proceede no further in time to come, and that the mindes of men may bee ſetled in the trueth of their ſaluation, I haue thought it my dutie to the Church of God, to teſtifie my loue of the trueth, and my vnfained care of the knowledge of the fame among vs, and continuance thereof in our poſteritie, by taking paines to tranſlate into our vulgar tongue theſe bookes. Herein you ſhall plainly ſee, that albeit the death of Chriſt the ſonne of God, as touching the greatnes of the price, be ſufficient for the redemption of whole mankinde in the world, yea if there were many worlds of them, as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi> ſaith: yet the proprietie of redemption belongeth to
<pb facs="tcp:8467:3"/>
thoſe that are not the veſſels of the deuill, but the members of Chriſt by faith, and the grace of regeneration: the reſt, who liue without faith and regeneration not belonging to this redemption from ſinne and death: Or, which is all one, you ſhall ſee it proued by infallible teſtimonies of Scripture, by generall conſent of antiquitie, and of new writers, and by ſubſtantiall arguments, that redemption from ſinnes, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and ſaluation are benefits proper to the Church, and not common to all and euery one, elect and reprobate, beleeuer and vnbeleeuer, to the ſaued and damned. You ſhall plainly ſee (I ſay) that the Sauiour promiſed to the world, and preached of alwaies in the Church, by the mouth of all the holy prophets and Apoſtles, is appoynted by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be a propitiation through faith in his blood in all, and vpon all that beleeue onely: and that this benefite of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring and redemption of mankinde, albeit it be proper and peculiar to the Church, as touching the efficacie of it, yet it is vniuerſall altogether in that ſenſe, wherein we beleeue and confeſſe the holy Church of Chriſt to be vniuerſall. Againſt this trueth the aduerſarie fighteth eagerly and impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with bitter reproches and lyes, grieuous blaſphemies, flat contrarieties, groſſe abſurdities, peruerting the naturall ſenſe of the ſacred Scripture, and abuſing the ancient writers. But all theſe his weapons wins him not the victory, for either they be blunt and cannot hurt our cauſe, or elſe the edge of them is turned againſt himſelfe: and his owne maſters in whom he glorieth, <hi>Luther, Brentius,</hi> and the reſt, whoſe diſciple and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower he would faine be, leaue him in his bad cauſe, nay are brought in plainely, reprouing and condemning his opinion as erronious, and ſpeaking for the trueth on our ſide. Nay further it is here flatly auouched, that the olde Pelagian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and impietie, which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> long agoe confuted, and the Church of God then condemned, is the father of the birth, and beginning of our aduerſaries opinion.</p>
            <p>As for the treatiſe of Predeſtination annexed hereto, it ſerueth ſpecially for the fuller euidence and greater certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thoſe things that are handled in the former bookes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:8467:4"/>
the vniuerſalitie of grace and redemption. For the remnants of the Pelagians of old, and at this day, affirming none at all to bee excepted from the redemption of Chriſts blood, and in reſpect of God maintaining eternall life to bee prepared for all, are therefore fallen to the extolling of ſuch grace, becauſe they would in no caſe confeſſe, that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purpoſe &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of his own will, in his ſecret iudgement but manifeſt worke, maketh one veſſell to honor, and another to diſhonour: nor will aſſent hereto, that the number of the predeſtinate can neither be increaſed nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed. Both which points are fully handled, and plainly proued againſt them in this booke.</p>

This is briefly the ſumme of theſe bookes, which I haue tranſlated for the benefit and helpe of the common ſort, that vnderſtand them not in the Latin tongue, that by reading and vnderſtanding hereof they that erre, may returne againe to the trueth and imbrace it hereafter the better; they that doubt, may be fully reſolued hereby; and they that haue held this doctrine as the trueth of God in time paſt, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed therein, and incouraged to profeſſe it to their liues end.</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELLENT AND RENOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MED PRINCE, AND LORD, THE LORD Frederike the fourth, Count Palatine on the Rhene, Duke of Bauarie, of the ſacred Romane Empire, chiefe Sewer and Elector, his moſt gracious Lorde and Prince.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST noble Prince Elector, and gracious Lorde, many things are required in a good Prince, beeing Gods Vicar among men: among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wiſedome, which containeth the knowledge of diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, is a ſingular beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of him, and a paſſing good defence.

And to vſe a grauer witneſſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 6.</note> the multitude of wiſe men is the ſafetie of the worlde, and a prudent king is the ſtay of the people, ſaith the wiſe man. For which cauſe alſo <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon Dauids</hi> ſonne, the wiſeſt king of mortal men, when in his tender yeres he had receiued the gouernment of the kingdome, hauing choiſe offered him of God to aske what he would, craued onely wiſedome.<note place="margin">In Alcibiades</note> 
               <hi>Plato</hi> alſo reporteth what was the cuſtome of the <hi>Perſians</hi> in bringing vp the eldeſt ſonnes of their kings, that were to ſucceede in the kingdome, and how they aquainted them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their tender yeres with the ſtudy of wiſedome and vertue, to the intent they might gouerne the kingdome at length with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
<pb facs="tcp:8467:6"/>
After this ſort it was. At their age of foureteene yeeres the kings ſchoolemaſters (as they were called) being foure choſen out of all the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the wiſeſt man, the iuſteſt, the moſt temporate, &amp; the valianteſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did vndertake the charge of them. The firſt taught them the worſhip of the gods, and kingly inſtructions. The ſecond aduiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to affect &amp; fauour the trueth in their whole life. The third that they would not be ouercome with any deſire, but accuſtome themſelues to liue like freemen, &amp; in very deed kings, ruling themſelues aboue al things, &amp; not ſeruing any deſires. The fourth made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtoute, leaſt through feare they ſhould commit any thing not beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their dignitie, and become ſeruants. This inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one that ſhould be a Prince floriſhed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the <hi>Perſians.</hi> And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they rightly iudged, that he ought to be trained vp in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of wiſedome, that is, of religion, and of the kingdome: but that being ignorant of Gods trueth, they imbraced a falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion through the magical inſtruction of <hi>Zoroaſter.</hi> An inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction not vnlike, albeit euery way farre better, as being taken out of the cleereſt fountaines of heauenly wiſedome, hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto your Highneſſe, moſt gracious Prince. Neither haue the praiers of <hi>Salomon</hi> been wanting, both of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, (which from your childhood hauing taken delight in the knowledge of profitable and good things, hath beene earneſt in dayly prayers with God, and is vnceſſantly inſtant, deſiring to be indued by him with an vnderſtanding heart:) and alſo of all good men, who publikely and priuately haue moſt regarded that thing, and not without cauſe. And how much hath been effected thereby, manifeſt experiments doe teſtifie, and ſuch as ſhall be with thankefull hearts made knowne to poſteritie to the honour of God. Firſt becauſe that noble Prince and Lord, the Lord <hi>Iohn Caſimire,</hi> Tutor, and a ſecond parent as it were, to your Highnes, being lately taken out of this life, your flouriſhing age, and already ripe to gouernment, and your iudgement riper than your age, (moſt excellent <hi>Frederike</hi>) haue afforded vs a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and ſolace in ſo hard a caſe. Then, becauſe after you had taken vpon you the gouernment of moſt large Dominions, wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oyfully haue ſeene ſuch trials of your great vertue, and ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:8467:6"/>
foundations haue beene layd of good gouernment, although in a lamentable and wicked time, that it hath lifted vp the mindes of all men vnto a ſingular good expectation. Goe on forwarde therefore in this minde and vertue (moſt noble prince Elector,) be ſtrong in the Lord and in his mightie power, remember the Lordes exhortation in old time to <hi>Ioſhua: I will bee with thee, as I was with Moſes. I will not leaue thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Be of good comfort that thou mayeſt doe according to the Law. Let not the booke of the Lawe depart from thy mouth. Then thou ſhalt deale wiſely and proſperouſly in all things. In like maner alſo the holy man <hi>Dauid</hi> (as we read) diligently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his ſonne <hi>Salomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 2.</note> when being as yet a child hee was now conſecrated to raigne. The Lorde God, who taketh away,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.</note> and appointeth Princes, and from whom commeth wiſedome and fortitude, endue your highnes more and more with vertue from aboue.</p>
            <p>But moſt noble prince Elector, and gracious Lorde, ſeeing theſe foure bookes of the Redemption of mankinde, and Gods Predeſtination being written by me a yeere agoe, ſhould nowe come abroad vnder the authoritie of your gouernment, I thought that this my duety ſhould be acceptable to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, if I ſhould intitle and offer them moſt humbly vnto you: and that in reſpect of that thankefulneſſe, whereunto I am many wayes bound to your Highnes. I know well inough, that I am not able this way to make a full recompence, yet freely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame is the propertie of a thankefull perſon. Further becauſe in theſe and the like Eccleſiasticall controuerſies, that ariſe from reſtles wits, it is meete that Princes especially ſhould haue the knowledge and cuſtodie of the trueth, to the intent that malicious detractors and deprauers may doe the leſſe hurt to Chriſtian religion. At this day we are ſlandered of malicious men with a new crime that is fained againſt vs, as though wee ſhould deny that Chriſt died for al men. An impudent reproach. For according to the Scriptures we alſo confeſſe the ſame, but we denie, that thereupon it followeth that all mankinde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any one, are by the death of Chriſt indeed iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſaued, and restored into the boſome of grace, hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:8467:7"/>
the pardon of their ſinnes, whether they beleeue or no. This is a deuiſe of man, and therefore to be refuſed, if wee will retaine the conſent of the Prophets and Apoſtles,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.</note> to wit, that euery one that beleeueth in Chriſt Ieſu, receiueth remiſſion of ſinnes through his name, the wrath of God abiding vpon the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers.</p>
            <p>Now the doctrine of Predestination, according to which God ſaueth in mercie ſome of the damnable lumpe of mankind, and in iuſtice puniſheth others for their ſinnes, being in the ſame lumpe vtterly forſaken, is of it ſelfe plaine, if we deſire ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to follow the direction of Gods ſpirit, than the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of fooliſh reaſon. But reaſon being troubled with the depth of Gods grace and his iudgement, leaueth here nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſayd, as we may ſee by the example of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> old and newe: the firſt <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of old time ſoundly confuted, and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> the latter.<note place="margin">De ſer. arb. &amp; alibi.</note> Therefore let thoſe men that would be counted <hi>Lutherans,</hi> looke to it, how they doe agree in iudgement both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Luther,</hi> &amp; the truth it ſelfe alſo with the <hi>Pelagians</hi> But I make an end, praying God, that vnder your Highnes the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of peace, learning and pietie, may alwayes floriſh. Amen. <hi>At Heidelberge the 12. of March. 1592.</hi>

Chriſt is required of vs, whereby as it were by a hand, we may apprehend him, and apply him with all his merits and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits vnto our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>This is the Catholike faith and confeſſion, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles taught, the Martyrs confirmed, and the faithfull as yet do keepe. For ſo the holie Apoſtle Paul deſcribing this whole myſterie in few but cleere words ſaith:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23, 24, 25, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>All haue ſinned and are depriued of the glorie of God and are iustified freely by his grace thorow the redemption which is in Chriſt Ieſu; whom God hath ſet forth to bee a reconciliation thorow faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſnes by the forgiuenes of the ſinnes paſt, that he might be iuſt, and a iustifier of him which is of the faith of Ieſu.</hi> And the Author to the Hebrewes writeth on this maner:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11. <hi>to</hi> 16</note> 
                     <hi>But Chriſt comming a high prieſt of good things to come, by his owne blood entred once into the holy place, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternall redemption. For if the blood of buls and goates ſanctifieth the vncleane to the purifying of the fleſh; how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternall ſpirit offered himſelfe without ſpot to God, purge your conſciences from dead works to ſerue the liuing God? Therefore he is the Mediatour of the New Testament, that through death which was for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions, which were vnder the former Testament, they which were called, might receiue the promiſe of eternall inheritance.</hi> Where, by the way is to be conſidered, that <hi>(by ſins paſt)</hi> in the ſaying of the Apoſtle to the Romanes, are properly vnderſtood the ſinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnder the old Teſtament, which could not be purged with the blood of goates and calues, but the righteous did expect a better oblation,<note place="margin">

And confirming the ſame from the rite of the old Teſtament, he addeth, that that was not dedicated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood, and that all things almoſt according to the Law were purified with blood: and that the paternes of heauenly things were purged with the blood of ſacrifices: but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things themſelues required a better ſacrifice and a better blood, namely the ſame, whereof Chriſt himſelfe, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing forthwith to fulfill the New Teſtament, witneſſed: <hi>This is my blood of the New Testament,</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The anſwering or taking away of certaine Questions about the maner or meanes of redemption.</head>
                  <p>BVt there is a queſtion in this place;<note place="margin">1. queſtion. Why he muſt needs redeeme vs by a price, &amp; not take vs out of Satans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer by force, who did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly hold vs captiues.</note> what neede was there of the paiment of a price by the Sonne of God, that wee might be redeemed, who were the ſlaues of Satan? for it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth more conuenient, that he, who is violently and vniuſtly detained of another, bee taken away from him by a ſuperiour power, euen without any price. And the deuill had vniuſtly inuaded vs. I anſwere, this price was not paied to the deuill, but to God, who had power ouer vs to condemne vs, and had made vs ſubiect to the power of the deuill by his iuſt iudgement. For as touching the deuill, he vniuſtly poſſeſſed man: but man in the meane while was iuſtly made ſubiect as a ſlaue to Satan through his owne ſinne, and the righteous iudgement of God. Therefore Chriſt ſatisfied God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vs, offering himſelfe vnto him by his eternall ſpirit,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</note> and ſo now the kingdome of Satan is neceſſarily deſtroyed, concerning vs that be reconciled to God, whom by our ſins we had offended. Notwithſtanding, Ambroſe <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 77. writeth that the price of our deliuerance by the blood of our Lord Ieſu, was paied vnto him, to whom we were ſold by our ſinnes, that is, to the deuill. But that is a very hard ſaying. For whereas it was not lawfull to offer ſacrifice, but vnto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, how much more ought this peculiar ſacrifice to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to none, but to God alone, which the eternall high prieſt offered vpon the Altar of the croſſe, by the ſacrifice of his fleſh and effuſion of his blood, and which onely is the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for the ſinnes of the world?</p>
                  <p>Further it is a queſtion;<note place="margin">2. queſtion. Why his death is a price ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> from whence that dignitie of the paſſion and death of Chriſt ariſeth, that it is a price ſufficient for the redemption of mankind? There be many cauſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to that effect.</p>
                  <p n="1">I.<note place="margin">Cauſe 1. His willing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> The willing obedience of the Sonne to the death of the croſſe, Phil. 2.8. for the paſſion of Chriſt had not been ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8467:13"/>
vnleſſe it had been voluntarie. Hereof the Apoſtle, Rom. 5. ſaith: <hi>As by the diſobedience of one, many are made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one, many are made righteous.</hi> And he ſpeaketh (as Theophilact well expoundeth) of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Chriſts death: by which obedience, death being deſtroyed, wee are deliuered from the damnation of death. And for this cauſe, the Euangeliſts with one conſent deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the hiſtorie of Chriſts paſſion, haue diligently noted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circumſtances, which declare that he ſuffered willingly. For hee was offered,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay.</hi> 53.10.</note> becauſe hee was willing, as Eſay ſaith, chap. 53.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. The death and whole humiliation of Chriſt was not onely voluntarie,<note place="margin">His innocency. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</note> but alſo he ſuffered death when he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together innocent, as a man who had committed no ſinne, and in whoſe mouth there was found no guile. For ſuch an high prieſt became vs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26.</note> as was godly, innocent, vndefiled, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from ſinners, who had no neede to offer firſt for his owne ſinnes, and then for the ſinnes of the people. Therefore becauſe the iuſt ſuffered for the vniuſt,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</note> his blood, as of a lambe vndefiled and without ſpot, is worthily counted precious to worke our redemption: as it is in Peter 1. Epiſt. 1.</p>
                  <p>Auguſtine largely vrgeth this cauſe in his 13. booke of the Trinitie, chap. 14. <hi>He died</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who alone was free from the debt of death. Therefore it was iuſt, that debters ſhould be let goe free, beleeuing in him, who died without any debt.</hi> The ſame man, chap. 15. <hi>The blood of Chriſt, becauſe it was his, who had no ſinne, at all, was ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſinnes.</hi> And in the chapter following: <hi>The deuill held our ſinnes, and for them worthily bound vs in death: he who had none of his owne, diſcharged them, and was by him vnworthily drawne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death.</hi> Alſo Pope Leo ſaith very cleerely: <hi>The band of death drawne together by the ſinne of one, was looſed by the death of one, who alone owed nothing vnto death.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">His perſonall dignity, in that he was both God and man.</note>III. The third cauſe, which is greateſt of all, the death of Chriſt was not a meere mans death, although innocent and iuſt: but it was his death, who is both true God and man in one and the ſame perſon. And this exceeding great dignitie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8467:13"/>
of this perſon, is the cauſe that this price of his blood &amp; death, although it was temporall, (if the continuance of it be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) yet it is of infinit force to ſaue them for euer, who come vnto God by it. Which the Author to the Hebrewes, chap. 9. teacheth, ſaying: <hi>If the blood of buls and goates and the aſhes of a yong heifer, ſprinkling the vncleane, do ſanctifie to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the fleſh: how much more doth the blood of Chriſt, who offered himſelfe by the eternall ſpirit without blame to God, purge your conſciences from dead workes, to ſerue the liuing God?</hi> And Acts chap. 20. Paul is witneſſe: <hi>that God by his owne blood redeemed his Church.</hi> Not that the deitie hath fleſh or blood, (for God is a ſpirit) but that perſon which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death for vs, is both God and man: and ſo this blood is, and is truly called the blood of God, whoſe excellencie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and dignitie is exceeding great.</p>
                  <p>To theſe this is annexed, that beſide his power diuine,<note place="margin">His Lordſhip ouer vs, and his neerenes in blood vnto vs.</note> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> abundantly ſufficient to deliuer, our commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Redeemer had alſo the full and perfect right of redemption, both becauſe he is Lord of all, &amp; alſo becauſe he is neere vnto vs in blood. For by the right of Lordſhip, it is meete that the ſeruant bee redeemed of the maſter, and the ſubiect of his prince: and by the right of kindred the father doth well redeeme the ſonne, one brother another, and one kinſman another. And hither may be referred, that which we reade, Leuit. 25.25. to be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ordained touching the right of neerenes of kindred.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly alſo this hath been a queſtion,<note place="margin">3. queſtion. Why muſt we be redeemed by his death rather than by ſome other meanes.</note> as touching the meanes of redemption, whether the deliuerance of vs could not poſſibly haue been by ſome other meanes, then by the death of the Sonne of God? Wee anſwere with Auguſtine, <hi>lib.</hi> 13. <hi>de trinit.</hi> that another way was poſſible to God, vnto whoſe power all things are ſubiect: but this was the meeteſt way and moſt fit with God to heale our miſerie. Or, as Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 46. decideth this doubt, we do diſtinguiſh betweene poſſible or impoſſible ſimply, and that which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort. To ſpeake ſimply and abſolutely, it was poſſible to God to deliuer man by another meanes, then by the death of Chriſt, becauſe nothing is impoſſible with God. Luk. 1.37.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8467:14"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> But after a ſort,<note place="margin">Becauſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</note> or by ſuppoſition of Gods foreknowledge and fore appointment it was impoſſible, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords words do plainly ſhew, Matth. 26. <hi>Father, if this cup cannot paſſe away, vnles I drinke of it, thy will be done.</hi> Whereupon Hilary ſaith: <hi>Therefore the cup cannot paſſe, vnles he drinke it, becauſe we cannot be reſtored but by his paſſion,</hi> becauſe of the decree of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Gods will. Moreouer, it is plaine that that way is moſt fit with God and meeteſt to cure our miſerie,<note place="margin">Becauſe this way was moſt iuſt with God</note> which God vſed through the paſſion of his Sonne. For it was a iuſt thing, that for the ſinnes of mankinde, the iudgement of God ſhould be ſatisfied thorow puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and that the ſame nature which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> had ſinned, ſhould alſo giue a recompence for ſin. Further, it was agreeable to the trueth and goodnes of God:<note place="margin">Moſt agreeable to his truth. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.</note> to the trueth, becauſe a threatning had gone before: <hi>What day ſo euer thou ſhalt eate of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, thou ſhalt die the death:</hi> and it was promiſed, and euer by continuall teſtimonies ſhewed, and by diuers ceremonies ſhadowed, that the ſonne of God, borne of a woman, ſhould dye for vs, and ſo ſhould confirme the new couenant by his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> blood.<note place="margin">To his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and mercy.</note> And to the goodnes of God it agreeth, becauſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man of himſelfe could not ſatisfie for ſinnes, God of his exceeding great mercie gaue vnto him a ſatisfier, euen his only begotten ſonne.

                  <p>IT followeth, that we conſider diligently of the time alſo of this redemption purchaſed for vs by Chriſt. And it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the hiſtorie of the Goſpell, that our Lord and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, our King and high Prieſt Ieſus Chriſt came into the world,<note place="margin">Chriſt was borne in the 42. yere of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, <hi>Anno mundi</hi> 3963.</note> made of the ſeede of Dauid after the fleſh, in the 42. yeare of the raigne of Octauius Auguſtus, which was the yeare of the world 3963. after Funccius ſupputation. Yet I am not ignorant, that others diſagree from that account, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the olde Latines and Greekes aſcending vp to the 5000. yeare, but by a plaine error in account, which riſeth from the difference betweene the Hebrew copies and the Greeke Septuaginte. But to proceede in my purpoſe, the Lord from the time of his comming and appearing in the fleſh, ſuſtained all his whole life both in bodie and ſoule, the wrath of God againſt the ſinne of all mankinde: but ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his end,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.</note> when he bare our ſinnes in his bodie vpon the

And it is recorded, that this was done in the 34. yere of the incarnation of Chriſt,<note place="margin">He ſuffered death in the 18. yere of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius, being 34. yeres old: or as Epiphanius ſaith, 32. yeres, and 74. daies, on the 12. day of the Calends of Aprill, that is, 21. of March.</note> and in the 18. of the raigne of Tiberius Caeſar. Yet Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius <hi>contra Alogos haereſ.</hi> 51. will haue all the yeres of Chriſts preſence in the fleſh from his birth to his paſſion, (which he writeth was done the day before the 13. of the Calends of Aprill) to be only 32. and 74. daies, differing one yeare from the former opinion. And the ſame man diligently refuteth the naughtie ſupputation of others, who miſunderſtanding that propheſie of Eſai, chap. 61: <hi>that I may preach the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table yeare of the Lord,</hi> thought, that the Lord, after he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed only one yeares miniſterie after his baptiſme by Iohn, ſuffered death in the full thirtith yeare of his age.

And their Conſulſhip fell in the 31. yeare of Chriſt, as Epiphanius witneſteth.</p>
                  <p>But now to omit the curious ſearching out of theſe things, leaſt any ſhould marueile, that Chriſt after ſo many thouſand yeares, ſhould bee made manifeſt at the length vnder Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, as it were in the euening of the world,<note place="margin">

Hereupon ſaith Peter,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the world after ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares, was appoynted ſo from al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in Gods counſell, as the Scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs.</note> that the Lambe (by whoſe precious blood we are redeemed) was made manifeſt in the laſt times for our ſakes, being foreordained before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the world were layd. And by the witnes of Paul, Gal. 4. God ſent his ſonne made of a woman, after the fulnes of time was come. And he meaneth the time of the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sonne, and of our redemption by him, which was before appointed of his heauenly father, which thing the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude vſed in that place doth declare. For he had ſaid that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8467:17"/>
the heire being an infant is vnder tutors vnto the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of the father. So, Epheſ. 1. he mentioneth the fulnes of times, for the reſtoring of all things by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And that we may more certainly vnderſtand, that this time of the reſtoring of all things was by God from all eternitie appointed, the ſame was by diuine inſpiration plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the mouth of the holie Prophets,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.</note> who (as Peter tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth) foretold of the grace that ſhould come to vs, ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when, and at what inſtant, that foreſhewing ſpirit of Chriſt that was in them, ſhould declare the paſſions that ſhould happen to Chriſt, and the glorie that ſhould follow.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Beſide this, we reade Luk. 16. that poore Lazarus was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Angels into Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s boſome, where he had ioy, and that the rich man in hell lifting vp his eyes ſaw Lazarus a farre off: and alſo that Abraham ſaid: <hi>Betweene vs and you there

is a great gulfe firmely ſet.</hi> It is abſurd, as Auguſtine noteth, <hi>ad Euod. Epiſt.</hi> 99. that only two, Abraham and Lazarus were then in that memorable boſome of reſt. If (ſaith he) there were more then two there, who dare ſay, that the Patriarches and Prophets were not there? From hence thus I reaſon: The Patriarches and Prophets and the reſt that were righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in old time, were receiued into Abrahams boſome: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not into hell. The conſequence is proued, becauſe hell in the Scripture is no where taken in good part. But that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of Abraham is vſed in good part, as the habitation of a memorable and certaine ſecret reſt. Therefore we muſt not beleeue that that boſome was ſome part of hell. This reaſon is wholly Auguſtines vnto Euodius. And the ſame he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by the words of our higheſt teacher ſaying, that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſaid: <hi>Between vs and you there is ſet a great gulfe:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſufficiently appeareth (ſaith Auguſtine) that the boſome of ſo great felicitie, is not any part or member as it were of hell.</p>
                  <p>He addeth alſo this proofe: If the Scripture (ſaith he) had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſaid, that Chriſt being dead came into that boſome of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, not naming hell and the ſorowes thereof, no man durſt haue affirmed that therefore he deſcended into hell.</p>
                  <p>Now let the reader conſider,<note place="margin">The Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens fained deuiſes of foure hels.</note> whether theſe reaſons drawne by Auguſtine out of the Scripture, deſerue more credite then the trifling words of the Schoolmen, who haue deuiſed foure hels, that is, the hell of the damned, Purgatorie, and the two Limboes, one for Infants, the other where the holie fathers were before Chriſt: which laſt they make a part of hell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the reaſons brought out of Auguſtine.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto may bee added, that a man may ſee the deuiſers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of <hi>Limbus patrum</hi> to be much troubled in aſſigning the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance of the godly ſoules out of that priſon. For ſometime they attribute it to the paſſion of Chriſt, whereby he looſed the guiltines of the puniſhment of originall ſinne, wherein the fathers (as they thinke) were detained in hell, and opened the gate of the kingdome of heauen. Sometime they teach that it was needful for the ſoule of Chriſt to deſcend into the

For being looſed from the band of original ſinne, wherewith they were tied in hell, they could not bee detained there any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but with their iniurie, and the iniurie of Chriſts blood, through whom libertie to enter into the Sanctuarie was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and yet (as they wil haue it) they were not in heauen.

                     <note place="margin">The opinion of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</note>But this is the opinion of our aduerſaries, that Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difference died for the ſinnes of all men, and that all the ſinnes of all men are ſatisfied and clenſed by ſacrifice, not onely ſufficiently, but alſo effectually. Which thus they doe declare, that our heauenly father hath inſtituted and ordained in very deede a reconciliation with all and euery man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect of faith or vnbeleefe. But in them it abideth effectuall, who by faith receiue that reconciliation with God ratified by Chriſt his ſacrifice: and in thoſe, who refuſe it by vnbeleefe,<note place="margin">The aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſimile.</note> it is aboliſhed and taken away, no otherwiſe then if a common bath were erected for many ſick perſons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all in very deed are reſtored to health, and ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by intemperance do loſe againe their former health, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in others which liue ſoberly. Which ſimilitude truly much differeth in ſenſe, from thoſe which Auguſtine and Stapulenſis vſed before.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, they profeſſe and write plainly that Chriſt ſuffered, was crucified, dead, and hath ſatisfied no leſſe for the ſinnes of all which alreadie are damned, and hereafter to bee damned, then for the ſinnes of Peter, Paul, and of all the Saints: that is to ſay, that Chriſt not onely gaue that which was ſufficient to haue taken away the ſinnes of all men: but alſo that in very deede the ſinnes no leſſe of the damned,<note place="margin">Marke this ſtrange doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</note> and ſuch as ſhal be damned, then of thoſe that are ſaued, and ſhal bee ſaued, are waſhed away in his blood. And they auouch, that it commeth to paſſe, that neuertheleſſe the former ſort
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8467:27"/>
are condemned, not for their ſinnes, for they are indeed clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſt, but for vnbeleefe alone, whereby they deſtroy againe, and make vneffectuall that reconciliation, which was made and done for them.</p>
                  <p>This was the opinion of Iacob Andreas in the Conference at Mompelgart, which Huberus <hi>theſ.</hi> 19. ſetteth downe in this maner: to wit, <hi>That Chriſt ſuffered and died not for ſome men only, but for al the poſteritie of Adam, none, (and to ſpeake it moſt plainly) none at all excepted out of the whole vniuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of mankinde, whether he receiue to himſelfe ſaluation by faith, and continue in ſaluation obtained, or els through vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe refuſe ſaluation wrought for him, and therefore periſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for euer.</hi> We ſee that he boldly auoucheth that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently all and euery one, beleeuers and vnbeleeuers haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in very deede ſaluation in Chriſt, but that ſome in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing continue in ſaluation receiued, others are depriued againe of the ſame by not beleeuing. The ſame man <hi>in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendio theſ.</hi> 10. ſaith: <hi>Wee boldly affirme, that Chriſt by his death hath mercie vpon all men in very deed and in truth, and gaue himſelf a ſacrifice for ſins, no leſſe for euery infidell then for euery faithfull man, to wit, that he may deliuer from death, the deuill, and hell, all men whoſoeuer they be:</hi> he meaneth in very deede and in truth, (as wee vſe to ſpeake) and not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently onely. And that nothing may be obſcure, he maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that the worke of ſaluation by Chriſt belongeth to all ſinners, and that ſuch as by Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue ſinned,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>theſ.</hi> 65.</note> and that all are truly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly together deliuered by the death of Chriſt from all ſinne and condemnation, and whole mankinde receiued in deede into the fauour and boſome of the father:<note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:8467:28"/>Vnto this opinion as new and vnheard of, and many waies erronious (as it ſhall appeare) we cannot ſubſcribe: but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the old diſtinction wee affirme, that Chriſt ſurely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited that which was ſufficient to haue taken away all ſins, and ſo they are taken away,<note place="margin">Our opinion of the death of Chriſt for all men.</note> and that all are redeemed, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſufficiencie or greatnes and power of the price, as Auguſtine expoundeth. But as touching efficiencie, we ſay that by the death of Chriſt, the ſinnes onely of the elect are blotted out, who beleeue in him, and ſticke vnto him as the members to the head:<note place="margin">Chriſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally died for the elect and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full onely, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> but ſuch as are not incorporated into Chriſt, cannot receiue the effect of his paſſion. For as the Lord ſaith: <hi>God ſo loued the world, that he gaue his ſonne that euery one that beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh, but haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. He that beleeueth is not condemned: but he that beleeueth not, is condemned alreadie,</hi> Ioh. 3. Which in that place Iohn Baptiſt confirming, teſtifieth: <hi>He that beleeueth in the Sonne, hath eternall life: but he that beleeueth not in the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> And in this ſenſe, and not abſolutely and without reſtraint, is it to be taken, as oft as it is read in our writers, that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not for all: to wit in reſpect of the effect of his paſſion, which belongeth to ſuch as are to bee ſaued, and not to them that ſhall be damned; to the faithfull, and not to Infidels. And ſo Beza alſo declareth himſelf <hi>Colloq. Mompelg. pa.</hi> 217. And there is nothing in him, which is not in ſo many words, and in the ſame ſenſe written by the old writers.</p>
                  <p>Neither are cauillers to be regarded, which ſay: what need is there to ſay,<note place="margin">Huberus theſ. <hi>1154.</hi>
                     </note> that Chriſt is a price ſufficient for the whole world? why bewitch ye men with theſe termes?

                     </note> But (ſay they) the word <hi>ſufficiently</hi> taken in that ſignification wherein ſacred antiquitie tooke it, we refuſe not, but rather approue it. But our Caluiniſts (ſay they) deuiſing a wrong and doubtfull ſignification of the word, doe deceiue the ſimpler ſort. For this they meane, that Chriſts death is ſo mightie, that if he would helpe all men
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8467:28"/>
by the ſame, he could eaſily doe it.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>theſ.</hi> 1152.</note> But if they would vſe the word of <hi>ſufficiencie</hi> in another ſignification, as when we ſay againſt the Papiſts, that the death of Chriſt is ſufficient for al men, that is, needeth no helpe of mans works to redeeme vs: or els alſo in this ſenſe, when we ſay, that Chriſts death is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all, whether men beleeue and be ſaued, or beleeue not, and periſh: yet that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for al, we would not refuſe the vſe of this terme in ſuch a ſignification.</p>
                  <p>But I thinke it is plaine enough by the things which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited before, how antiquitie hath vſed thoſe termes of <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie</hi> and <hi>efficiencie,</hi> neither that wee change any thing in the ſenſe, or deceiue any by doubtfull ſignification. In the meane while the thing it ſelfe proueth, that the ſimpler ſort are here beguiled by our aduerſarie, who when hee would ſeeme to allow the terme of <hi>ſufficiencie</hi> in that ſenſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in antiquitie accepted it, yet he deuiſeth of his own head ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications altogether vnknowne vnto antiquitie, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded oppoſition: otherwiſe we defend alſo againſt the Papiſts, that the merit of Chriſt needeth no helpe of mans workes: neither deny we, that he hath ſatisfied for al whether they bee ſaued or periſh, to wit, as touching the ſufficiencie and greatnes of the price ſo mighty and rich for redemption, that if the vniuerſalitie of captiues would beleeue in him, the bands of the deuill ſhould hold back none.</p>

                  <p>THe former generall anſwere is plaine and ſound and may ſuffice alone: yet we think good particularly to examine the ſayings of the holie Scriptures touching the death of Chriſt for all.</p>

                     <hi>God will that all ſhould be ſaued, and come to the knowledge of the truth: for there is one God, and one Mediatour of God and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8467:35"/>
men, the man Chriſt Ieſus, who hath giuen himſelfe a raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for all.</hi> Here they firſt vrge the words, that God will that all be ſaued: whereof they will haue gathered, that therefore once all men, none excepted, are in deede ſaued by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption of Chriſt, without any reſpect of faith, or vnbeliefe, although many afterward loſe againe, through vnbeleefe, ſaluation that was obtained. But the Apoſtle entreateth of that ſaluation which is by faith, as Theophilact well expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and the matter it ſelfe ſheweth: and not of a certaine vniuerſall ſaluation of beleeuers and vnbeleeuers. Further, the Apoſtle knitteth ſaluation and the knowledge of the truth together, as things moſt neerely ioyned between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. <hi>He will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that all men be ſaued, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> After the like maner therfore let them inferre, that all men alſo, none excepted, come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, that is, to faith, and by conſequence to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, which conſiſteth in the knowledge of God and Chriſt. Thus the argument is fully anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Yet as touching the minde of Paul, the place needeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, as Ambroſe alſo admoniſheth. For if God (who verily is Almightie, and doth whatſoeuer he will, in heauen and earth) will haue all men to be ſaued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, why is not his will fulfilled? Neither ſay, as the Pelagians vſed to except, (as Auguſtine witneſſeth) that therefore this will of God is not fulfilled, becauſe men will not. For no free will doth withſtand God being willing to ſaue, as he teacheth <hi>de correp. &amp; grat. cap.</hi> 14. for ſo to will or not to will, is in the power of the willer or niller, that it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth not Gods will, nor ouercommeth his power. For he himſelfe doth the things that he willeth, concerning thoſe men who doe not his will: ſeeing euen of the very willes of men, he doth what he will. Therefore many waies ſurely that Apoſtolicall and diuine ſentence may rightly be vnderſtood, that the very beginning of our faith ſhake not, wherein wee profeſſe that wee beleeue in God the father almightie, Of which waies we will recite one or two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, albeit none but the elect come to ſaluation, and that

effectually called by the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">The firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.</note> by that vocation which is according to the purpoſe of God: yet God by his word calleth al to beleeue, and to conuert, that they may be ſaued, and not iudge themſelues vnworthie of the kingdome of God. For this is that good, acceptable, and perfect will of God, that all heare the Sonne, repent, and beleeue the Goſpel vnto ſaluation. As alſo Ezechiel teſtifieth, chap. 18.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>EZec.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 37</note>

But why this gift of grace, to wit, conuerſion, (without which none can be ſaued) is not beſtowed vpon all by him, who would haue all to bee ſaued, it muſt be referred to the hidden iudgements of Gods iuſtice. For who hath knowne the minde of the Lord? or who firſt gaue to him, that he ſhould recompence him? This expoſition Luther alloweth <hi>de ſeruo arbit.</hi> handling the place of Ezech. chap. 18.<note place="margin">Luther.</note> 
                     <hi>In that ſaying</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will not the death of a ſinner, we ſee no other thing handled, then that the grace of God is preached and offered in the world, which they only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, in whom the law hath already wrought his dutie, that is, the knowledge of ſinne. The rest contemne mercie promiſed in that ſaying. But why ſome are touched by the law, and others are not touched, ſo that they receiue, theſe refuſe grace offered, it is another question, and is not handled here by Ezechiel, who ſpeaketh of the preached and offered mercie of God, and not of that hidden and reuerend will of God, ordaining in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, whom and what maner of men he will haue to bee capable and partakers of the mercie preached and offered. Which will is not to be ſought after, but with reuerence to be honoured, as the ſecret of Gods maiestie, reſerued to himſelfe alone, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden vs. And anone after: God doth many things which he doth not ſhew vnto vs by his word: and he willeth many things alſo, which in his word he ſheweth not that he willeth. So he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8467:36"/>
will not the death of a ſinner, to wit, in his word: but he willeth it by that his vnſearchable will. But we muſt reſpect his word, and leaue his vnſearchable will.</hi> Againe, comparing this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent place of the Apoſtle with the place of the Prophet, hee addeth: <hi>If thou ſpeake of God preached vnto vs, he will that all men ſhould be ſaued, while he commeth to all in the word of ſaluation, and it is the fault of our will which doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him, as it is ſaid, Matth</hi> 23: <hi>How oft would I gather thy children, and thou wouldeſt not? But why the diuine maieſtie doth not take away this fault of our will or change it in all, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not in the power of man: or why he imputeth that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſeeing man cannot want it, it is not lawfull to enquire, and though thou ſhouldeſt ſeeke after it, yet thou ſhalt neuer finde it.</hi> Theſe things ſo largely I am not aſhamed to produce out of Luther, becauſe of our aduerſaries.</p>

That is likely to be true, but it is meete, and right according to the nature of charitie, that Paul ſhould iudge of all the ſonnes of the Church at Rome and elſewhere, (ſo long as the contrarie did not appeare) as of the beloued and elect of God, as he witneſſeth of himſelfe, Phil. 1.7 and 1.

vnto the fellowſhip of ſaluation and grace, according to the minde of this diſputer. But all things are ſubiect vnto him, becauſe he hath rule ouer all, is Lord of all whether they be beleeuers or vnbeleeuers; of theſe to death, of the other to life, as Faber Stapulenſis hath well written vpon this place. To that that he writeth, that the reprobates are ſubiect vnto Chriſt, as their Sauiour, that is, that they might bee ſaued, wee will then conſent, when he hath taught, that al things are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto Chriſt for ſaluation, euen ſheepe and oxen and the very deuils.

and conſequently the power of Satan, who is as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine executioner of Gods wrath to puniſh.

I anſwer, that it is a fallacie <hi>à dicto ſecundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quid,</hi> that is, <hi>from a ſaying ſpoken in part.</hi> For as we rightly ſay, that Chriſt doth aboliſh and take away ſinnes, that is, the workes of the deuill, by iuſtifying and gouerning his owne (albeit in the meane while ſinne ceaſeth not to raigne in very many): ſo the deuill is worthily ſaid to bee aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.</note> although his power continueth towards the children of diſobedience. Let other places be compared, wherein the Greeke word is extant, as 1. Corint. 1.28. Romanes 6.6. and 2. Tim. 1.10.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they be the expreſſe words of the Apoſtle: <hi>That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Chriſt tasted death for all, that he might ſet them at libertie, as many as were all their life ſubiect vnto bondage.</hi> To this we anſwere: if this ſaying be meant of the efficacie of Chriſts death, the vniuerſall particle doth not comprehend all men and euery one: but all who are ſanctified, as here and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what after the Apoſtle himſelfe declareth. For when he had made mention of death which he taſted for all, ſtraightwaies he annexeth a declaration of the ſonnes of God, as it were painting out a certaine companie or armie of them, before whom (being to be brought from the kingdome of that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Pharao into the true land of promiſe, and the glorie of the heauenly kingdome) goeth cheerfully that firſt begotten ſonne of God, the prince and author of their ſaluation, who died for them all and roſe againe, and being crowned with glorie and honour, carieth before them his croſſe as it were for a ſtandard, and prepareth and fortifieth the way for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And a little after: <hi>They that are ſanctified,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and hee that ſanctifieth, are all of one.</hi> Where by thoſe that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he noteth ſuch as are appointed to the ſaluation of their ſoules, and muſt be brought vnto glory, as he had ſaid before.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8467:40"/>
In theſe ſurely the efficacie of Chriſts death is extant, and not in thoſe who are not ſanctified: as after alſo in the 10. chapter he ſaith, that Chriſt by one offering hath made perfect for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them that are ſanctified. And theſe bee they of whom Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaketh, Ioh. 17. <hi>Father I ſanctifie,</hi> that is, <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my ſelf for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they may be alſo ſanctified through the truth:</hi> to wit, they who are giuen to the ſonne by the father, and are his people, as the Apoſtle alſo ſaith, verſ. 17. of this chapter to the Hebrewes: <hi>Christ was in all things made like to his brethren, that he might be mercifull, and a faithfull high Prieſt in the things of GOD, to ſatisfie for the ſinnes of the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for that which is mentioned of deliuerance from bondage and the horror of death by the death of Chriſt, wee may finde this effect alſo in the godly, who being armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt corporall and ſpirituall death,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.24.</note> with the death of Chriſt as with a remedie againſt all euill, haue paſſed from death to life. And ſo Brentius himſelfe in <hi>Expli. Catech.</hi> expreſſeth this ſaying, page 164. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath aboliſhed death by his death, not, that we ſhould not die bodily, but that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death ſhould not bee the deſtruction of him who beleeueth in Chriſt: for he is preſerued in death to eternall life.</hi> Albeit as touching this later member, wee are to know, that the text may be indefinitly read, as the old tranſlation hath it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Luther in the Dutch: <hi>that he might deliuer them, who through feare of death were all their life ſubiect to bondage.</hi> For the Grecians, as Stephanus in his Theſaurus warneth, doe take <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>In Adam all of vs are wrapped vnto condemnation by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> one only offence: but Chriſt doth deliuer his not only from that one originall ſinne, but alſo from all actuall ſinnes.

For he ſaith: <hi>Not as the offence, ſo is alſo the free gift of God: for guiltines entered in vpon one offence vnto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but the gift that God beſtoweth, is giuen vpon many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences to iuſtification.</hi> And after another maner declaring the abundance of grace, he ſtraightway addeth: <hi>For if by one offence death raigned through one, much more they, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that exceeding grace &amp; gift of righteouſnes, ſhal raigne in life by one Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, if ſinne be ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to death, how much more grace to life, nay to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in an heauenly life?

                  <p>To theſe it may bee added, that it falleth out not through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the penurie of redemption, or ſome inſufficiencie of grace and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſt, that many are not ſaued, but through their owne vnbeleefe.

And that quickening is meant, according to ſound interpreters, either of the common reſurrection of ſome to life, and of others to condemnation: or els (which is better liked of) of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes and glorie of the godly. If the firſt ſenſe be allowed, no argument can thence bee drawne for the vniuerſall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and ſaluation of all men. If the later, it is certaine, that that quickening ſhall not bee of all men ſimply, but of all the elect onely.<note place="margin">August. ep. <hi>28.</hi>
                     </note> Auguſtine vnderſtandeth quickening in that place in the later ſenſe, and ſheweth that therefore it is ſaid both there <hi>all</hi> and here <hi>all,</hi> becauſe as all who die, die not but in Adam, ſo all who ſhall be quickened, ſhall not be quickened but in Chriſt.<note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> Ambroſe <hi>in Comment.</hi> referreth that word <hi>all</hi> vnto the vniuerſalitie of the elect. <hi>As death</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>held all who came of Adam, ſo alſo Chriſt purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed life for all, who bee of his bodie.</hi> To whom alſo Hierome ſubſcribeth in the expoſition of this place.

But he cutteth his throate with his owne ſword. For if wee muſt ſticke to vniuerſalitie without any reſtraint, why doth he reſtraine the generall note to mankind alone, and expoundeth <hi>all things,</hi> that is, <hi>all men?</hi> Before thoſe words of the reconciliation of all, went that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>All things</hi> which are in heauen and earth were made by Chriſt; and <hi>all things</hi> conſiſt in him; and that he was before <hi>all things:</hi> and hath the rule ouer <hi>all things.</hi> Why doth hee now goe from that vniuerſalitie of all things repeated ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſo few words, and expoundeth it of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone, that <hi>all things</hi> are ſaid to be reconciled by Chriſt?

But three expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of any moment are brought foorth, to omit other of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8467:43"/>
leſſe account. The firſt is, that the whole creature ſimplie needed the remedie of the death of Chriſt: men truly, that ſinne and death being deſtroyed, they might obtain through faith euerlaſting ſaluation: and Angels, that by the repayring of men, and the coniunction of earthly things with heauenly, they may fully reioyce: laſtly, the Elements and the viſible creature for the deliuerie of it ſelfe from deſtruction and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> for the very creature it ſelfe alſo (as Paul witneſſeth) ſhall be freed from the bondage of corruption, into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the glorie of the ſonnes of God. This expoſition is Theodorites <hi>in Comment. ad Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; Heb.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Other expound it of Angels and men. Hereupon <hi>Auguſt. Ench ad Laur. c.</hi> 62. <hi>In Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the things in heauen are reſtored, when the full of Angels is recompenced out of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the things in earth are repaired, when men themſelues, who were predeſtinated vnto eternal life, are renued from their old corruption.</hi> And in the ſame place expounding the words to the Coloſ. 1. <hi>How</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are heauenly things pacified, but in vs, that is, in agreeing with vs?</hi> For earthly things were ſeparated from heauenly for the contrarietie of life, as Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome hath noted vpon that place.</p>

Rightly truly. For Paul ſaith not that peace was made betweene heauenlie and earthlie things, betweene Angels and men: but that God had recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to himſelfe, both the things which are in heauen, and which are in earth. And that ſo it ought to bee conſtrued, the Greeke text doth proue, albeit others conſtrue it with the verbe that is tranſlated, <hi>making peace.</hi> Further, the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is added, <hi>(Therefore vs truly hath he now reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, who were in times paſt ſtrangers and enemies)</hi> doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare, that the proprietie of reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belongeth to the faithfull: and that the vnbeleeuers, as long as they bee ſuch are void of reconciliation, and enemies of God.</p>

I anſwere: ſeeing wee are to iudge charitably of others, ſuch are counted and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned for faithfull and elect, and therefore reconciled and heires of righteouſneſſe and eternall life, whoſoeuer profeſſe with vs the faith of Chriſt: but then they be truly that, which they are called, if they continue in that, for which they are ſo called. But if they haue not perſeuerance, they are not truly ſo called, as Auguſtine writeth <hi>de Correp. &amp; grat. cap.</hi> 9. But of this more at large afterward in the arguments of the ſecond ranke or order.</p>
                  <p>The aduerſarie alſo warneth vs, to marke well in the words of the Apoſtle <hi>ad Col.</hi> 1. that he not onely ſaid, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was preached to all the Coloſſians, but the <hi>hope of the Goſpel.</hi> And yet it is in the text, <hi>neither be ye moued away from the hope of the Goſpell, which ye haue heard.</hi> Therefore it is a marueilous attention of the man, who bids vs marke here that which is not found at all in the text, neither if it were found, could make any thing for the matter.<note place="margin">Heb. <hi>2.2.</hi> Luk. <hi>11.28.</hi> Hieron. in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> For the hope of the Goſpell pertaineth not to the hearers, but to the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: and as Hierome ſaith: they that liue contrary to the Goſpell, cannot expect the hope of the Goſpell. That thing rather ought here to bee marked, that Paul ſheweth that the Coloſſians are reconciled to God no otherwiſe, but as men alreadie conuerted and beleeuing. <hi>You which in times paſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were ſtrangers, hath he now reconciled.</hi> For in theſe words there is a manifeſt contrarietie of their double ſtate, to wit, of faith and infidelitie. Before being ſtrangers and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, now they were reconciled in that bodie of the fleſh of Chriſt. Where then is that generall reconciliation euen of thoſe that beleeue not, nor euer will beleeue?</p>

Let a ſyllogiſme bee made, and the falſe concluſion will ſtraightway appeare. For the maior is falſe taken vniuerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as it ought to bee taken: that, ouer whomſoeuer Chriſt hath power giuen him, they are reconciled to God. For he hath power giuen him ouer oxen, aſſes, and all creatures in heauen and earth, euen ouer the deuils alſo. But what if we ſtay only in mankinde? after this ſort: What men ſoeuer are giuen of the father to Chriſt, they be therefore giuen, that he might giue them eternall life. Now all men are giuen of the father to Chriſt, becauſe he hath giuen him power ouer all fleſh, to wit humane: Therefore al men are therefore giuen vnto him, that hee might giue them eternall life. I deny the minor, in that ſenſe as here and elſewhere often that maner of ſpeech is taken, to bee giuen to Chriſt. For proofe I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, it is another thing, that power is ſaid to bee giuen ouer al fleſh to Chriſt, than that al men are giuen to him.

                     <hi>Who are they, whom hee ſaith are giuen him of his father? are they not they, of whom elſewhere it is ſaid: No man commeth vnto me, vnleſſe the

They are then thoſe, whom he hath receiued of the father, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he alſo choſe out of the world, that now they may not be of the world: and yet they are alſo the world, beleeuing and knowing that Chriſt was ſent of God the father.

Where he ſheweth, that he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued power ouer all men, to deliuer whom he will, and condemne whom he will: but that thoſe are giuen vnto him, to all whom he may giue eternall life. For ſo he ſaith, that all that thou haſt giuen him, he may giue vnto them eternall life.

For the force of Baptiſme is of God alone, and not of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, ſaith Ambroſe <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 217. So the ſenſe of this place is, that it belongeth not to Moſes, but to God to giue that true bread from heauen: that Moſes as a ſeruant in the houſe of God gaue them Manna, corporall foode, and the figure of that ſpiritual, which God giueth, and not man.

For, that ſinnes may not be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs, but that we may bee made the righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt (as this reconciliation of the world is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of Paul) a true faith in Chriſt is required:<note place="margin">

And ſo of the new writers Illyricus alſo, whom our aduerſaries vſe greatly to aduance, declareth in his gloſſe. What if thou maiſt ſee Iacob Andree himſelfe <hi>Coll.

                  <p>This then being graunted of the <hi>ſufficiencie</hi> and power of this propitiation, I ſay according to the propounded diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that in very deed notwithſtanding, the blood of Chriſt doth profit the faithfull vnto the appeaſing of Gods wrath, and not the vnfaithful: as it is plainly written, Rom. 3.24.25.

                  <p>THere bee alſo other places of the Scripture cited, which teach that the Goſpell belongeth to all: as, that which Paul, Rom. 16. teſtifieth: <hi>that that mysterie was kept ſecret from al eternitie, and was declared in his time to all nations by the decree of the eternall God.</hi> And Coloſ. 1. of the ſame my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie hid from the world and the former ages, he ſaith: <hi>that it was then reuealed by God to his Saints, to whom hee would make knowne, what are the riches of this glorie among the Gentiles.</hi> Of the ſame ſort alſo is that which is alleadged out of Acts. 17. <hi>The times of this ignorance God regarded not, but now it is preached to all men euery where, that they repent.</hi> And to Tit. 2. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſaluation to all men hath appeared.</hi> Againe Luk. 24. <hi>Thus it is written, and thus ought Chriſt to ſuffer, and that repentance and remiſſion of ſins muſt be preached in his name among all nations.</hi> Such places as theſe are brought, not ſo much to proue an vniuerſall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of all men, as many as come of Adam: as to hurt, and with cauils to ſhift off the doctrine of Gods predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in many places is taught in the word of God, and ſo fortified with euident teſtimonies, as that it may bee preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it cannot bee oppreſſed. But of predeſtination wee haue
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8467:51"/>
purpoſed to ſpeake in another place, wee will not here vndiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly mingle things together. Yet three things I will briefly giue admonition of.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as I ſaid, becauſe the Goſpell is preached to all,<note place="margin">Three admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not be gathered thereof that redemption and righteouſneſſe and other riches of the grace of Chriſt therefore belong to all by proprietie and fruition: but the riches of the Goſpell are properly theirs who obey the Goſpell. For they are called bleſſed of Chriſt, who heare the word of God and obſerue it.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.</note> But in whom the word of the Goſpel is not mixed with faith, hearing doth not profit them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.</note> as is fully ſhewed in the epiſtle to the Hebrewes, by the example of the old people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay that it is fooliſh and falſe,<note place="margin">The 2 admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. <hi>Hub. theſ.</hi> 104. <hi>&amp;</hi> 107.</note> which theſe men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> meane, that the Goſpell of ſaluation doth preciſely belong to all and euery one, and that the riches of the grace of Chriſt bee equally exhibited to euery man among all nations, no man excepted at leaſt, as touching externall preaching. They proue it, becauſe the Apoſtle witneſſeth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.</note> that the myſterie of the Goſpell had been alreadie preached in his time among al nations, and declared to euery creature vnder heauen Alſo becauſe Chriſt commanded that repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes ſhould be preached in his name among all nations. In theſe places they would haue meant (by all nations) euery one in all nations (which is a very marueilous gloſſe.)</p>
                  <p>I anſwere, that by comparing of the like phraſes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>(All nations)</hi> is not taken in Scripture for euery one in all nations.</note> and by the thing it ſelfe, the falſhood of that gloſſe, as too groſſe and intolerable, is eaſily confuted. We reade 1. <hi>Paral.</hi> 14. the laſt verſe, that the fame of Dauid went out into all the earth, and that the feare of him was vpon all people. And Pſal. 118. he there complaineth, that all nations compaſſed him. Alſo we reade, that all nations were ſubiect to Nebuchadnezzar to ſerue him, Iere. 27. verſ. 7. and that his dominion was in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, and ouer all men and beaſts, Dan. 2.38. As alſo thoſe ſayings are: <hi>Ye ſhall be hated of all nations,</hi> Matth. 10. <hi>Teach ye all nations and baptiſe them,</hi> Matth. 28. <hi>He ſuffered all nations to walke in their owne waies.</hi> Act. 14.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8467:52"/>
of the faith among <hi>all nations.</hi> In like maner of the whore of Babylon, Apoc. 18.3. and 23. that <hi>all nations</hi> haue drunke of the wine of her fornication, and that <hi>all nations</hi> were ſeduced with her witchcraft. What monſtrous abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will ariſe, if in theſe and ſuch like places by all nations, ſhould be vnderſtood euery one in all nations?</p>

For the Apoſtle ſaith, that alreadie in his time the Goſpell was declared vnto all nations. For it is moſt certaine,<note place="margin">Very many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apoſtles time, and in their time, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of the Goſpell.</note> that long after the Apoſtles times, there were innumerable nations, among whom the Goſpell was not as yet preached: much leſſe, that while the Apoſtles liued, it was preached to euery one of all nations. Auguſtine witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 80. that there were innumerable barberous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Aphrica: to ſay nothing of ſo many other nations vnder heauen, lately conuerted to the faith of Chriſt. But Paul ſaith, that the Goſpell in his time was preached to all nations and to euery creature vnder heauen. That is true, but in that kinde of ſpeaking, wherein the former places in the holy Scriptures are vttered, and wherein <hi>all Iudea</hi> is ſaid to go out vnto Iohn, and was baptiſed of him. As alſo Hierome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the ſaying of Paul, <hi>that he taught all men in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> that is, the Iewes and Gentiles. For he were mad that would think, that the Apoſtle taught the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to euery one euery where.</p>
                  <p>But as for that, that the grace of God which bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is ſaid to haue ſhined to <hi>all men:</hi> it is very well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Hierome in <hi>Comment.</hi> to be ſaid to <hi>all men,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no condition is excepted: neither is there any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of bond and free, Grecian, Barbarian, circumciſed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed: but wee are all one in Chriſt, and all of vs are called vnto the kingdome of God, to be reconciled after we haue ſinned, not for our merits, but through the grace of our Sauiour.</p>

Goſpell, what ſhall wee ſay of ſo many thouſand children, who daily die and haue died hitherto, before they had the vſe of reaſon, or els at the leaſt, before they heard any thing at all of the grace of the Goſpel?

Of which thing let the reader peruſe Auguſtine <hi>ad Euodium Epiſt.</hi> 99.</p>
                  <p>Further, if it were very true, that now in the time of grace, the gift of hearing the Goſpell were equally exhibited to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one among all nations: what ſhall we ſay of the former ages, in the times of ignorance, wherein all nations were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to walke in their owne waies?

And of old the mercie of the Lord, which is not wanting in any generation, was ſet out vnto all nations by the teſtimonies of nature: but the doctrine of the Law and Prophets directed none but the houſe of Iacob, and ſome few other who laboured to haue part in the calling of the Gentiles, which ſhould come at the length.</p>
                  <p>The third thing that ſeemeth worthie of conſideration here, is this,<note place="margin">

                     </note> that albeit by the miniſters of the word and of the grace of God, the one truth and the ſame grace is preached to all, and the ſame exhortation is vſed: yet the like fruit follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in all.

To beleeue God, is to beleeue that the things bee true which he ſpeaketh, which many euill men can doe. And to beleeue that he is God, euen the deuils may. But to beleeue in God, they onely know who loue him, and who are Chriſtians not onely in name, but alſo in deedes and life. For faith without loue, is the deuils faith &amp; vaine: but with loue, it is the faith of a Chriſtian. And this faith of a Chriſtian ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the foundation, ſuffereth no man to periſh, as Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine writeth, which thing a certaine gloſſe alſo of Luthers vpon the 7.<note place="margin">De fide &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, cap. <hi>18.</hi>

                        <hi>It can not be, that they who haue been once inlightned, and haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of the heauenly gift, and haue been partakers of the holie Ghoſt, if they fall away, that they ſhould be renued againe vnto repentance, crucifying againe to themſelues the ſonne of God, and expoſing him to ignominie.</hi> They that here be deſcribed, are partakers of redemption, and yet reprobates. A particular concluſion followeth in the third figure: Therefore ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates are redeemed.</p>
                     <p>I anſwere. Firſt the aduerſarie ſhould haue proued an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall concluſion, and not a particular, as it hath bin ſaid. Secondly vnto the minor I ſay: they that fall away after illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination receiued,<note place="margin">A grieuous fall proues not a man to be a Reprobate.</note> are not forthwith to bee iudged repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and to bee excluded from grace, with Montanus and Nouatus. For euen the elect fall ſometime grieuouſly, but they are lifted vp againe of the Lord. And in that the Apoſtle ſeemeth to take away hope of pardon from ſuch as fall away, omitting other expoſitions, Chryſoſtome Theodorite,<note place="margin">Some of the olde writers vnderſtand by renewing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 a ſecond baptizing.</note> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact in their Commentaries, and Epiphanius <hi>haeret.</hi> 59.

But as once Chriſt died, and death hath no more power ouer him: ſo wee are once baptized into the death of Chriſt, by the lauer of regeneration, and renewing of the ſpirit, and it is impoſſible for vs, if wee fall, to bee by it renewed againe

vnto repentance. Which thing if a man attempt, hee cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth againe, and contemneth Chriſt, as much as lieth in him.</p>
                     <p>Further, vnto the maior: Albeit I willingly graunt, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſuch as bee redeemed, or els as though they were redeemed,<note place="margin">Two proofes of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of reprobates.</note> according to the foreſhewed difference of the elect and reprobates: yet the proofes brought in of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the aduerſarie haue no force.

collect, that many indued with true faith and conuerſion, and therefore by his death and blood waſhed, and iuſtified, doe periſh for euer. I anſwer as afore, that here properly the queſtion is not, whether ſome indued with true faith and conuerſion, doe ſo fall backe, that they periſh: but this the aduerſarie was to proue, that the reprobates vniuerſally no leſſe then the elect, and all vnbeleeuers no leſſe then the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, are made partakers of redemption in Chriſt.

But ſuch as abide in that error of the righteouſnes of workes, whether they haue knowne at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time the trueth of the Goſpell or no, it cannot be proued,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8467:66"/>
that they were euer truly redeemed from the curſe. For this redemption belongeth to them onely, who by true faith in Chriſt are the ſeede of Abraham, and are heires according to the promiſe, as is largely taught. Gal. 3.</p>

receiuers and contemners. For as we haue ſeene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, this cannot be plainely ſhewed by the heape of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which are brought: but this is the teſtimonie of all the prophets and Apoſtles with one conſent, and the ſumme of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">

Wherefore it is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of men, and not of Chriſt, that <hi>euery one whether he doe beleeue or not, doth receiue remiſſion of ſins through his name.</hi> Therefore let thoſe men lay aſide this boaſting of Scripture, who ſo plainely contradict the foundation of the Scripture, and let them take heede, leaſt their owne foote be ſnared in the gin they haue layed.

                     <p>But Huber by a ſophiſticall or deceitfull cunning paſſeth by thoſe things, which Auguſtine there largely writeth for the declaration of this article.

                     <p>But by their opinion who think that by the death of Chriſt all men are ſufficiently, but not effectually redeemed, (ſo as al and euery one haue remiſſion of ſinnes, and are receiued into the grace of God, iuſtified and ſaued, whether they beleeue or not) by the opinion of theſe I ſay, no certaine grace and ſaluation is propounded to ſuch as are baptized.</p>

                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> by their opinion Baptiſme is taken away. Vnles the argument bee thus framed, I ſee not how any thing can bee concluded to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>But the minor is denied.

But without ſuch long cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, O Huber, this thou ſhouldeſt proue, that, vpon the ſetting downe of the contradictorie of thine opinion of the generalitie of redemption, there would follow the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Baptiſme, and that therefore, becauſe no certaine grace and ſaluation can then bee promiſed to them that bee baptized.

Which things Baſill in his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Baptiſme wittily ſeemeth to comprehend. Baptiſme (ſaith he) is the releaſing of captiues and debt, the death of ſinne, the renuing of the mind, the ſhining garment, the way of heauen, the getting of the kingdome of heauen, and the grace of adoption.

                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that it was giuen to Abraham for a ſeale of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of faith, teaching, that Circumciſion was not giuen for righteouſnes, but for a ſeale of righteouſnes, which is by faith. And I ſay, (to the faithfull) becauſe neither the word nor Baptiſme promiſeth any thing to, or profiteth the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnbeleeuers. For it is a word of promiſe: <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth and is baptized,</hi>

                        <hi>ſhall be ſaued: but he that beleeueth not ſhall be damned,</hi> whether he be baptized or not.

Pſalme, writeth thus of the Iewes: <hi>Whereas the Sacraments were common to all, grace was not common, which is the vertue of the Sacraments. So now alſo the lauer of regeneration is common to all that are baptized, but grace it ſelfe, whereby the members of Chriſt with their head are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, is not common to all.</hi> Againe, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cont.

                     <p>I anſwer. Although we haue ſome men in our time, who thinke that euen infants beleeue, and would haue all men ſo to thinke: yet the contrarie opinion of Auguſtine, and other olde writers is more ſincere and ſafe.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> For thus Auguſtine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Iohn <hi>tract.</hi> 80.<note place="margin">Infants cannot beleeue.</note> ſaith, This word of faith, onely is of force in the Church, that euen neuer ſo little clenſeth the infant, by the Church beleeuing, offering, bleſſing and touching it,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8467:86"/>
though the infant cannot beleeue with the hart to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and with the mouth confeſſe to ſaluation. Likewiſe in his fourth booke of Baptiſme, chapter 24. hee ſaith: Infants through want of age can neither beleeue with the heart to righteouſnes, nor with the mouth confeſſe to ſaluation. See alſo his 23. epiſtle to Bonifacius, and Iuſtine Martyr, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion 56. Barnard alſo alloweth the ſame opinion, Epiſt. 77. Infants becauſe their age hindred them, cannot haue faith.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon is plaine,<note place="margin">And why they cannot.</note> for faith preſuppoſeth knowledge of thoſe things that are to be beleeued. And that little children do know diuine things, who as yet vnderſtand not humaine, if wee would by words declare, ſaith Saint Auguſtine, alſo Epiſt. 57. we muſt be afraide, leaſt we be thought to doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to our very ſenſes, ſeeing that by ſpeaking we endeuour to perſwade a thing, where the euidence of the trueth is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all the ſtrength and force of ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, they that maintaine the faith of little children,<note place="margin">The contrary opinions of Brentius and Andr, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the faith of infants,</note> doe not a little diſagree in opinions, ſome thinking that faith is giuen them in Baptiſme, and others before Baptiſme. Of the later opinion is Brentius, <hi>Explicat. Catechiſ.</hi> where hee maketh this argument: God acknowledgeth none truely in the number of his people, vnles he doe beleeue; and maketh his aſſumption of infants: The infants of Gods people in olde time, were part of Gods people, euen before they were circumciſed, and therefore our infants now alſo pertaine to the people of God, euen before they be Baptized, according to the promiſe made to Abraham, Gen. 17. <hi>I will be thy God, and God of thy ſeede after thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe Iacob Andree, Brentius his ſucceſſor defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the former opinion, <hi>Colloq. Mompel. fol.</hi> 458. Before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants (ſaith he) be Baptized, I cannot affirme that they doe beleeue, becauſe faith is giuen vnto them in Baptiſme. And ſtreight after: Infants Baptized haue the grace of adoption freely giuen them with faith and the holy Ghoſt. Likewiſe, Luther in 17. Gen. (albeit in his booke of praying, he ſeeme to thinke otherwiſe) hath left it written, that the children of the Iſraelites had this bleſſing, that on the eight daye, faith
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:8467:87"/>
was giuen them, and they were made the people of God: which thing he would haue in like manner vnderſtoode of the Children of Chriſtians in their Baptiſme.</p>
                     <p>And this opinion ſurely is driuen to a great ſtraight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of infants in olde time that dyed before the eyght day, when they ſhould be circumciſed, and depart this life daily as yet without Baptiſme, being depriued of it, not of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but of neceſſitie, whom yet they both doe rather rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon in the number of ſuch as be ſaued, ſeeing the couenant of God is not tranſgreſſed or made fruſtrate.<note place="margin">Luth. in <hi>17.</hi> Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                        </note> But after their opinion, no man, be he a childe or a man growne, can bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without faith. It followeth therefore, ſeeing ſuch alſo are ſaued, that faith is giuen to many infants euery where, euen before their Baptiſme: which thing Iacob Andree denied that he could auouch. The ſame thing may be obiected of young girles among the Iewes, who becauſe they were the ſeede of Abraham; were not excluded from the righteouſnes of Abraham, but obtained it by faith, according to Luther in the forecited place, euen in their infancie.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the opinion of the faith of infants is more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed than defended.<note place="margin">D. Heerbrand. Defenſ. cont. Gottard.

                  <p>FVrthermore, Paul the Apoſtle and teacher of the Gentiles, and a worthy preacher of the grace of Chriſt, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing among the Gentiles of the vnſearchable riches of Chriſt, and reuealing vnto all men, what is the communion of the myſterie that was hid from all ages: doth alſo euery where teach, that the grace of redemption pertaineth not to the vnbeleeuers, but to the faithfull, who now are not the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the deuill, but the members of Ieſu Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>That of many teſtimonies wee may onely alleadge a few,<note place="margin">The 1. place. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> he thus writeth to the Romanes, chap. 3. <hi>But now the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of God is made manifeſt without the law, hauing witnes of the law and the Prophets, to wit, the righteouſnes of God by the faith of Ieſu Chriſt, in all and vpon all that beleeue. For there is no difference. For all haue ſinned, and are destitute of the glorie of God, and are iustified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Ieſu: whom God hath ſet forth to bee a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſnes through the remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles iudgement is, that all mortall men ſimplie are vnder ſinne, and haue neede of the glorie of God: but he aſcribeth not righteouſnes to euery one that ſinneth, as our aduerſaries opinion is.<note place="margin">Hub. theſ. <hi>45.</hi>
                     </note> For he expreſſely defineth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of God to come through faith in Ieſu Chriſt, and more plainly addeth, <hi>that wee are iustified freely by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought by Chriſt, and that he is ſet forth vnto vs of the father to be a propitiation, but through faith.</hi>

                     <hi>Chriſt is in a readines ſet before the eyes of men to bee a propitiator, that he that will bee redeemed may come.</hi>

                  <p>Moreouer, this predeſtination of the Saints, is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God for the moſt part called Election.<note place="margin">Election di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſly taken in Scripture,</note> 
                     <hi>Many are called, but few are elect,</hi> ſaith the Lord, Matth. 20. And Paul, Ephe. 1. teſtifieth of the election of the faithfull in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundations of the world were laid. Yet wee muſt not be ignorant, that there be diuers elections of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſacred Scriptures make mention. For ſome are for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> execution of ſome certaine office, Ciuill or Eccleſiaſticall: namely, the office of a King, Prieſt, Prophet, or Apoſtle. So Aaron was approued to be the elect prieſt of God by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the rod that budded.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.5.</note> So his poſteritie who had the Prieſthood in Iſrael, are called the elect of the Lord. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Saul in reſpect of the kingdome is called the elect of the Lord. Beſides,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10, 24, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.6. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.</note> of the ſonnes of Iſai none but Dauid was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Lord to the kingdome.

                  <p>Further, Gods election is taken for election to ſaluation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and that two maner of waies, either that which was from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, or els that which is made in time, which floweth from the former, lying hid in the minde of God, and is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and execution therof, to wit, when a man is now actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen out of the world and ingrafted into Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated to eternall life. Of ſuch Chriſt ſpeaketh, Ioh. 15. <hi>Ye are not of the world, but I haue choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is beſide, this vſe alſo of the word, that they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Elect in generall, whoſoeuer by outward calling belong to the people of God. So Deut. 4. verſ. 37. and 7. verſ. 6. and 14. verſ. 2. all Iſrael is ſaid to haue been choſen of the Lord,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8467:129"/>
namely to be a holie people, and peculiar to the Lord their God, out of all people in the whole world. As alſo in Peter they are called elect, whoſoeuer are called to the bodie of the Church, and are counted faithfull. And 1. Cor. 1. ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paul: <hi>Ye ſee your calling bretheren, that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mightie, not many noble are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but God hath choſen the fooliſh and baſe things in the world.</hi> Where we ſee, that they that be called to the ſocietie of the Church, and the choſen or elect are taken for one and the ſame. For as Auguſtine, <hi>de correp. &amp; grat. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. ſaith: <hi>Who will denie them to bee elect, that beleeue and are baptized? They are plainely called elect, but of them that know not what they ſhall be, and not of God, who knoweth them. For there be ſonnes of God, who are not yet ſuch to vs, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to God:</hi> and againe, <hi>there be ſome, that are called of vs the ſonnes of God, for ſome temporall grace receiued, and yet are not to God ſuch, of whom Iohn ſpeaketh: they went out from vs, but they were not of vs. For if they had been of vs, verely they had continued with vs.</hi> The ſame thing Ambroſe alſo confirmeth vpon the 8. chapter to the Romans, and the Apoſtle himſelfe, while in the 11. chapter of that epiſtle, hee maketh difference betweene the people of God ſo in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall called, in reſpect of vocation, and profeſſion: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the remnant in the common aſſemblie, and as it were bodie of that people, which remnant is ſaued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the election of grace, and the reſt doe periſh.</p>
                  <p>And of that election of ſuch as ſhall bee ſaued, and haue beene predeſtinate vnto eternall life from all eternitie, do we nowe intreate.

of the Church and of the elect, there be as well euill as good (in the ſenſe aforeſaid:) Therefore all men are elected.

And the materiall cauſe ſurely men themſelues are, and thoſe things that God decreed to doe for the predeſtinate: as are, grace, faith, good workes, and perſeuerance in goodnes, &amp;c. in this preſent life, and glorie in reſpect of the elect; and puniſhment in reſpect of the reprobates in the life to come. Further, the definitions before alleaged doe ſhew the forme.<note place="margin">The finall cauſe.</note> The finall cauſe alſo both of election and reprobation is of Paul not obſcurely declared, when Rom. 9. he teſtifieth, that God would ſhew his wrath, and make knowne his power in the veſſels of wrath formed to deſtruction: but in the veſſels prepared for mercie, he would make knowne the riches of his glorie. Whereunto tendeth that alſo of Pharao: <hi>To this end haue I ſtirred thee vp, that I might declare my power, and that my name may be knowne in all the earth.</hi> And of the elect Epheſ. 1. he ſaith: <hi>He hath predestinated vs to be adopted for ſonnes, to the praiſe of his glorious grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Briefly, the laſt end of election and reprobation is the glorie of God, as the Wiſeman teacheth, Prou. 16. <hi>He hath made all things for himſelfe, euen the wicked againſt the euill day.</hi> But he would make manifeſt ſpecially his mercie in the ſaluation of the elect,<note place="margin">De bono per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer. cap. <hi>12.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But the queſtion chiefly in controuerſie is of the impulſiue cauſe of election and reprobation, (which is referred to the kind of efficient cauſes:) whether any cauſe can be aſſigned,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:8467:139"/>
which might moue God to chuſe and refuſe? To the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of which queſtion wee muſt diſtinguiſh. For the queſtion may be taken either generally,<note place="margin">Two queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, why he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elected ſome, and reiected others?</note> why he hath elected ſome, and reiected others? or particularly, of the election and reprobation of euery one, why he hath elected theſe men and reprobated thoſe? As for example why he hath elected Iacob before Eſau, Moſes before Pharao, Peter before Iudas? And of the firſt queſtion, wee muſt render a reaſon from the things, that before haue been ſpoken of the end of predeſtination. For the end, either is conſidered, as it is in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and as it followeth the action, and ſo it is properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an end: or els as being comprehended in the minde and deſire, it moueth the doer, and ſo it is counted the impulſiue cauſe. Therefore ſeeing in them that ſhall be ſaued God hath ſet downe the manifeſtation of his mercy to be the laſt cauſe,<note place="margin">The manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods mercie and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſiue cauſe.</note> and in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſhalbe damned, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manifeſtation of his iuſtice: and the end, as far forth as it moueth to doing, is to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the efficient cauſe, therefore this manifeſtation both of mercie and iuſtice, that is of the goodnes and glory of God, is after a ſort the efficient cauſe both of electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The ſecond particular, why this man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that? No reaſon but the onely will of God, can be giuen, why this man is elected, and that man is reprobated, ſhewed by two ſimilitudes.</note>But why he hath elected theſe men, and reprobated thoſe, wee can alledge no other reaſon thereof than the meere, moſt free, and moſt gratious will and good pleaſure of God. As ſurely in the vniuerſalitie of things, there may be a reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned why God in the beginning created one part of the firſt matter (being in it ſelfe wholly of one forme) vnder the forme of fire, another parte vnder the forme of earth, namely, that ſo there might be a diuerſitie of kinds in things naturall: But why this part hath this forme, &amp; that hath another forme, it muſt neceſſarily depend doubtles vpon the ſimple will of the creator. So alſo, (to vſe another ſimilitude from artificiall things,) if a man ſhould gather many like and equall ſtones together, and purpoſe to build with them, a reaſon may eaſily be rendred in reſpect of the end, why he ſetteth ſome ſtones in the top and ſome in the bottome. To wit, becauſe it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit to the perfection of the houſe, that there be both a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation hauing ſtones belowe, and a top or ridge of the wall, hauing ſtones aboue. But why among equall ſtones he layeth
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:8467:139"/>
theſe in the toppe, and thoſe in the bottome, there is no other reaſon, but becauſe it ſo pleaſeth the workeman. So wee muſt confeſſe alſo that the caſe is here alike, and the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely teacheth; <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will and whom be wil he hardeneth.</hi> And to the Eph. ſaith,<note place="margin">

Theſe mens declaration and profeſſion was, that all men ſinned in Adams ſinne, and that none are ſaued by their workes, but by the grace of God through regeneration: yet notwithſtanding that euery
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:8467:141"/>
man hath ſo much of naturall grace left, that he may attaine vnto that ſauing grace by the helpe of the firſt grace, if he wil. Therefore in reſpect of God, that eternall life is prepared for all, but in reſpect of free will, that it is apprehended of them, that ſhall beleeue in God, willingly as of themſelues, and ſhall receiue the helpe of grace by the merite of faith. Or els to ſpeake more plainely: They did defend againſt the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, that a man is not able of himſelfe to riſe againe, and to worke wel, yet they ſuppoſed that euery one had in him a wil to riſe againe, which ſeeketh only after the phiſition, but can do nothing of it ſelfe: and they ſaid that no mans nature was ſo extinguiſhed or depraued, that it ought not, or was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be willing to be healed: and therefore that they obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both increaſe of faith, and alſo the whole effect of their holineſſe, by that merite whereby they haue beene willing, and haue beleeued that they may be healed of their diſeaſe, when the occaſion of obtaining ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is preached to them that are caſt down, and can neuer riſe vp againe in their own ſtrength. Neuertheleſſe they conſented herein, that no man had ſufficient power of himſelfe, euen to begin a work, much leſſe to bring it to perfection. For they diſtinguiſhed between works and faith, whereof they would haue, if not the increaſe, yet the beginning albeit ſlender to conſiſt in the power of man, that the beginning of ſaluation may bee beleeued to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from him that is ſaued and not from him that ſaueth, and that the will of a man ſhould bee thought to procure for it ſelfe the helpe of Gods grace, and not that grace ſhould bee thought to ſubiect the will vnto it. And this poſition being layd,<note place="margin">Marke theſe errors of the Semipelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> that all men haue a wil in them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may either contemne or imbrace ſaluation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, they thought that the reaſon of ſuch as are elected or reiected is ſoone giuen to wit, that God before the creation of the world foreknew who would beleeue, or who would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide or not abide in that faith, that after ſhould be holpen by his grace: and according to this preſcience that hee either choſe ſuch as would beleeue, or els reprobated ſuch as would not beleeue, or at the leaſt whom hee foreknewe that they

                     <note place="margin">The 4. reaſon.</note>4.

For the vnſtable will of man bendeth hither and thither, like a reede ſhaken with the winde. On the contrary, election ſtandeth firme and vnmoueable in the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, purpoſe, and gratious will of God towards vs in Chriſt Ieſu, as the Apoſtle at large ſheweth, Rom. 8. ſaying: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them that loue God, all things worke together for good, that is, to them that are called of his purpoſe. For whom he foreknew,

Yea in all theſe things we are more then conquerors, through him that loued vs. I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor any other creature, is able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God, which is in Christ Ieſu.</hi> Therefore ſeeing we are men, let vs not leane vpon our infirmitie, but let vs commit our faith, hope, life and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſtronger, rather than to the weaker; to God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than our ſelues, profeſſing (as the trueth is) that all things depend vpon his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Hitherto is to be referred euen the example of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour himſelfe, and our head Ieſu,<note place="margin">The 6. reaſon.</note> which Auguſtine cannot ſufficiently commend.<note place="margin">De predeſt. ſanct. cap. <hi>15.</hi> &amp; de bon. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeu. cap. <hi>24.</hi>

Which aduancing of mans nature is ſo great and ſo high, that he could not aduance it higher, as the deitie it ſelfe could not abaſe it ſelfe lower for our ſakes, than in that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the nature of man with his infirmitie vnto the very death of the croſſe.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe things mans nature in Chriſt ſingularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that is, our nature through none of our merits, but of the onely grace of God. Therefore we alſo are predeſtinated vnto eternall life, not through our workes, but through the purpoſe and grace of God predeſtinating vs. For there is one and the ſame reaſon of the head and the members: but this is the difference, that he alone is predeſtinate to bee our head, we being many are predeſtinate to bee his members. And therefore in the head is the fountaine of grace, and from

So in al the workes of the moſt higheſt thou maieſt ſee, two things, whereof one is contrary to the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. We are here admoniſhed, that all men are equall and alike by nature and beginning: as by nature the dayes are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: alſo the veſſels are like one another, being made of the ſame claie, as touching their matter and originall. We alſo all of vs are of the ſame claie, or of one and the ſame lumpe: for we all do draw our beginning from the earth. Thereof came Adam, the firſt that was created, and of Adam we all. Neither haue all mortall men the ſame originall onely, but alſo the ſame condition of byrth; becauſe all of vs are in ſin borne of Adam, ſeeing he fell a waie from his firſt creation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are taught in the foreſaid words, that whatſoeuer and what maner ſoeuer differences there be among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they come from God, who aduaunceth ſome, and abaſeth others, bleſſing ſome, and curſing others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no other cauſe of this difference alledged, but the diſpoſition, will, wiſedome, and iudgement of the moſt lighteſt: who ſeeing he is the creator of all things, he obtayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the chiefeſt and vncontroulable ſoueraignetie ouer all his

                  <p>I proceede vnto Paul, who as a learned ſcribe in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen bringeth out of his treaſure new things and old to the confirmation of this doctrine.

And ſo the Apoſtle entreth into the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and profound doctrine of predeſtination: wherein, (that wee may ſpeake of the matter now in hand, omitting other thing) he plainely teacheth, as touching the cauſe of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that God conſidering that he is moſt free, electeth whome hee will of meere grace, and reprobateth whom hee will, in the iuſt, albeit ſecret counſell of his owne will.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Iacob 8. Eſau.</note>1. He teacheth this by the example of Iacob and Eſau, of whom the one was prefered before the other, by the meere fauour of God: becauſe when as they were both equall in all things, being conceaued of one copulation, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children as yet vnborne, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had done neither good nor euill, an oracle was giuen vnto their mother Rebecca: <hi>The elder ſhall ſerue the yonger.</hi> Therefore election is not of workes, but of grace.

                  <p n="6">6. Vnles it were thus, the Apoſtle anſwering the obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alleaged, would not reiect it with indignation, ſaying, <hi>God forbid,</hi> but thus he would or might anſwer the queſtion, that God deſtinating euery one to puniſhment or rewarde, according to his merits, at the leaſt foreſeene, cannot bee thought vniuſt. This had been a moſt plaine and eaſie defence of Gods iuſtice.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He vſeth a farre other anſwere, whereby hee ſeemeth not ſo much to diſſolue, as to binde faſt and confirme the queſtion, when he ſaith; <hi>He ſaid to Moſes, I will haue mercy, on whom I wil haue mercie, and I will haue compaſſion, on whom I will haue compaſſion.</hi> By which ſentence we are taught, that God, (albeit in a generall ſpeech he withdraweth his mercie from none) yet according to a certaine manner of mercie, he hath appoynted to haue mercie vpon ſome, and not vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that therefore, becauſe it ſo pleaſeth him: for ſo, when we would ſignifie a certaine free power, we are wont to ſay, <hi>I will doe, that I will doe.</hi>

But granting that, we deny the conſequence. For this is the Apoſtles meaning, and hitherto he aymeth, that for all the vnbelief and abiection of the greater part of the Iewes, God doth not caſt away his people, whom he foreknew, but ſaueth them according to the election of grace, as chap. 11. Rom. in plaine words that diſtinction is expreſſed.<note place="margin">A double elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iſrael.</note> So he conſidereth a double election of Iſrael: one generall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, wherby the whole carnall Iſrael being ſeparated from other people,<note place="margin">Generall.</note> was conſecrated to bee the peculiar people of God: of which election we reade Deut. 7. and elſewhere of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.

of ſuch as ſhall be ſaued according to the moſt free wil of the chuſer.</p>
                  <p>Rom. 11. there is a moſt manifeſt place. The Apoſtle ſaith:<note place="margin">The 1. place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</note> 
                     <hi>That God did not caſt away his people, whom he foreknew:</hi> that is, predeſtinated: for difference ſake from the carnall Iſrael, which alſo was the people of God by outward calling. For that abſurditie ſeemed to follow, if the Iewes ſhould bee caſt away for vnbeleefe, that God ſeemed to renounce his owne people. Here Paul diſtinguiſheth betweene the people of God <hi>called,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A foreknowne people.</note> and <hi>elected</hi> (or as he himſelfe calleth them) <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne:</hi> meaning the knowledge which is ioyned with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, according to which they are called foreknowne, whom God receiueth, &amp; whom he hath ſeparated as his own to be ſaued from other multitudes of men. Otherwiſe if the phraſe ſhould bee meant of bare knowledge, that reſtraint were in vaine, ſeeing euen ſuch as ſhall be damned cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the knowledge of God. And that hee might ſhew whom he calleth <hi>foreknowne,</hi> he added, by the example of the times of Elias, that among the vnbeleeuing and obſtinate people there was a <hi>reſeruation made according to election.</hi> And by and by hee ſaith: <hi>Iſrael obtained not that which hee ſought for: but the election obtained it, and the reſt were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened.</hi> Therefore in this election and in that reſeruation, which is made by the election of grace, hee would haue a people to be meant, whom therfore God had not caſt away, becauſe he foreknew them,<note place="margin">De bono perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. cap. <hi>18.</hi>
                     </note> as Auguſtine at large expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. But what ſaith he further of that election? what cauſe thereof doth he aſſigne, beſide the meere grace of the chuſer? For he ſaith: <hi>So at this time alſo there is a reſeruation made according to the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of grace,</hi> that is, free election, after the Hebrew phraſe. <hi>And if it be of grace, it is not now of workes: els grace is no grace: if of works, it is not now of grace, els worke were no worke.</hi> Nothing could bee ſpoken more roundly to exclude all reſpect of workes in men.</p>

                  <p>IT ſufficiently then appeareth by ſo many proofes alleaged, that God elected his Saints in Chriſt vnto eternall life, not for any workes, or through foreſeeing of their faith: but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purpoſe of his own will, of meere grace, <hi>which doth not finde,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. hom. in Io. <hi>38</hi> &amp; epiſt. <hi>106</hi>

                     <hi>but make them to be elected,</hi> as the ancient ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is. And albeit wee ſeeme with the ſame labour not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely to haue touched, what muſt bee held concerning the cauſe of reprobation: yet to make the matter more cleere, wee thinke good ſeuerally to declare,<note place="margin">The cauſe of reprobation, is the will and good pleaſure of God, and not foreſeene vnbeleefe, or ſinnes.</note> that the cauſe of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation conſiſteth not in the future vnbeleefe of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, or other ſinnes, which God foreſaw, but in the will of God himſelfe, chuſing whom he pleaſeth, and reprobating whom hee pleaſeth, by his will, which is ſurely remote from our ſenſes, yet moſt right, and to bee adored rather than cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſearched into.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The 1. reaſon. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.</note>For if ſinnes were the cauſe of reprobation, wee had all been reprobates: ſeeing all of vs are vnder ſinne, the children of wrath and eternall death, that ſuch election ſhould adopt, as abdication doth refuſe. And albeit the grace of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour bee offered vs in the Goſpell, yet it is Gods gift, that we begin to haue faith, and doe hold it vnto the end. <hi>For what haſt thou that thou haſt not receiued?</hi>

                     </note> that faith is not inſpired into them? Is it, becauſe they will not? No. For ſo on the contrary the elect ſhould therefore beleeue, becauſe they are willing: and ſo God ſhould not giue them faith but they by being willing ſhould beſtow it on themſelues, and ſhould haue ſome thing that they had not receiued.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The 2. reaſon.</note>Further, if wee ſhould conſider reprobation to ſlow from vnbeleefe, or from malice foreſeene, it wil neceſſarily follow, that election dependeth on faith or workes foreſeene.

                     <hi>Is there there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnrighteouſnes with God?</hi> and the anſwere to that obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and alſo the parable of the potter, of his owne power and will making veſſels to honour, and veſſels to diſhonour, fully confirme our opinion: that as wee can aſſigne no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon of the election of the one, ſo of the reiection of the other, but becauſe it ſo pleaſeth God, for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mercie or iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto may be added the caſe of innumerable children without the Church, who are preuented with death,<note place="margin">The 5. reaſon.</note> before they haue the iudgement of reaſon, and cannot bee iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued for the neglect of helping grace. If ſuch as diſſent from vs be asked concerning theſe, whether they thinke that none of them doe periſh, they dare not I ſuppoſe denie: If they periſh, they are reckoned among thoſe whom God hath reiected: yet he could foreſee in them no contempt of grace, ſeeing they ſhould not haue it, yea he foreknew rather that they ſhould not contemne grace.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth that deuice any thing helpe them, that God
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:8467:155"/>
ſaw what they would doe if they had recouered. For God in puniſhing and pardoning reſpecteth not what any man would doe, but what good or euill he hath done in his body. Thus it is manifeſt, that the reprobation of the vngodly, no leſſe than the election of the Saints dependeth vpon the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will of God, and not vpon the foreſeene good or euill wils of men.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it materiall, that ſome perſons defame this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by this or that name, and endeuour to make it odious.

For iuſtification is the effect of election, as euen ſaith it ſelfe, whereby wee are iuſtified, according to the ſaying: <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinated, them hee hath called,</hi>

Wherefore the very effects of election may be ſo ordered, that one is the cauſe of another, as faith of iuſtification, iuſtification of glorification: but no effect of election can be conſidered as the cauſe thereof; and by conſequent faith, ſeeing it is the effect of election, cannot be thought to be the cauſe of it as well as of iuſtification.<note place="margin">The effect of Reprobation is Gods forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after which follow vnbeliefe and other ſinnes.

of Paul, <hi>Whom hee calleth, them hee alſo iuſtifieth.</hi> And how neceſſary this benefite is to the elect for the obtaining of their appointed ende of life and heauenly glory, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to euery one. For ſeeing we are all vnder ſinne, and for ſinne are guiltie of wrath, and eternall damnation; we cannot ſee the kingdome of heauen, vnles we be abſolued from ſins,<note place="margin">What it is to be iuſtified.</note> and accounted iuſt before God, by the free forgiueneſſe of them. And this is nothing els, than to bee iuſtified as the word is here taken. So Paul Rom. 4. defineth iuſtification, by the imputation of righteonſneſſe: And this he teacheth to conſiſt in the forgiuenes of ſinnes, alleaging hereunto the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of Dauid, Pſalme 32. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes are couered.

                     <note place="margin">Iuſtification diuerſly taken in Scripture.</note> Otherwiſe diuerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the word <hi>Iuſtification</hi> is taken in the ſcriptures. For one while it ſignifieth the acknowledging and declaring of one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to be good and righteous, that is, ſuch a one in deed: <hi>as that God is ſaid to bee iuſtified in his ſayings:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

As Apoc. 22. it is written: <hi>He that hurteth, let him hurt as yet, and he that is iuſt, let him bee iuſtified as yet.</hi> Thirdly, by the proprietie of the Hebrewe tongue, the iudiciall ſignification as I may ſay of the word is moſt vſuall in the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, namely, <hi>that to be iustified, is to be abſolued from guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> the word being taken relatiuely, &amp; not noting any quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. So it is vſed Prouerb 17. verſ. 15.

Certainely therefore are we iuſtified of him, when wee, that are in our ſelues guilty of hell before the iudgement ſeate of God, are neuertheleſſe by his grace diſcharged from all guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, ſo that the aduerſarie cannot any more condemne: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he reputeth vs freely iuſt through redemption in Chriſt Ieſu, by faith in his blood, and not of workes.</p>

This is nothing elſe than of mercie to make wrath, of wrath mercie, by an alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether croſſe kinde of ſpeech. And if then God bee ſaid to harden, when hee doth good, and forbeareth; and to haue mercie, when he afflicteth and chaſtiſeth, then God ſhall not bee ſaid to haue hardened Pharao, but contrariwiſe to haue had mercie on him.

                  <p>But let the obiection be turned vpon them, that ſo bring in predeſtination, that they ſeparate the means from the end. In old time ſuch was the hereſie of the <hi>Predestinati,</hi> who,<note place="margin">The hereſie o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Another obiection was of deſtiny,<note place="margin">The ſecond obiection of fate or deſteny.</note> that it was brought in if all things depend on the ſtable &amp; immutable decree of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination;</hi> as for example, who ſhall receiue the word, who not: who ſhall beleeue, who ſhall not, and thereby who ſhall be ſaued, who damned.</p>

is taken from this, that in the ſcriptures we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to beleeue the remiſſion of ſinnes, and eternall life, and that not onely hiſtorically, and generally, but alſo with the application of the promiſe of grace vnto vs; as alſo euery where the holy Scriptures require vs to beleeue in Chriſt, who died for our ſinnes, that he might reſtore vnto vs Gods grace that was loſt righteouſneſſe and eternall life.<note place="margin">To beleeue and to doubt are contrary.</note> Now to beleeue, and to doubt, are manifeſtly contrary one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as we may ſee in Iames, cha. 1. <hi>If any of you want wiſedom, let him aske of God but with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence,</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> What is meete for vs to iudge of the election of other men.</head>
                     <p>FVrthermore, by the grounds that hitherto haue been laid open concerning the certaintie of our election, it is no hard thing to iudge, what we are to thinke being Chriſtians, of the election of others in Chriſt, according to the rule of Chriſt, that is, Charitie: to wit, we ought not onely to be ſure of the predeſtination of our ſelues in Chriſt, but alſo to iudge the ſame thing of our brethren in Chriſt: and not to deſpaire of others before their death.</p>
                     <p>We here make a difference betweene brethren, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe with vs the ſame faith, and thoſe that are without, who are vnbeleeuers as yet, and ſtrangers from the ſocietie of a holy brotherhood.</p>
                     <p>As touching our brethren, albeit a faithfull man cannot iudge ſo certainly of others as of himſelfe, ye the ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:8467:200"/>
and acknowledge them for elect,<note place="margin">In whom we ſee faith and repentance, we muſt count them for elect.</note> ſo long as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doth not appeare. The reaſon is, becauſe faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion be ſignes of election. Therefore whom we iudge to be partakers of faith &amp; conuerſion, thoſe alſo muſt we needs comprehend in election. And of this iudgement we haue the Apoſtles of the Lord for authors. 1. Pet. 1. Eph. 1. &amp; 1. Theſ. 1. where Paul ſaith, <hi>Wee know brethren beloued, that ye are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of God, becauſe our Goſpell was among you not in word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in power, in the holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance.</hi> And 2.

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:8467:201"/>
that they concluded, that the faith of Auguſtine, and others, that rightly iudged of this matter, was contrary to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore ſayd, that albeit it were true, yet it was not to bee taught, but to be buried in ſilence rather. The ſame thing Hilarie (not Biſhop of Pictauia, but of Atls) reporteth in his Epiſtle to Auguſtine, not onely of the Maſſilians, but alſo of other brethren in France.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And they were moued chiefly with theſe reaſons. 1.

For when they thinke that all things depend on predeſtination, (who ſhall beleeue, who not, who ſhall be ſaued, who damned) and the ſame doubtles vnchangeable, that neither he that is reiected can by any endeuour enter in, nor he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is elected, can poſſibly by any negligence fall away, men are become ſluggiſh &amp; dull: ſo that being prone to ſlide from labour to luſt, they follow their owne concupiſcences.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Further, they ſayd there was danger, leaſt reproofes and exhortations ſhould waxe colde.

For theſe things therefore, and ſuch like, in old time thoſe brethren throughout France, euen ſuch as durſt not finde fault with the opinion of the ſoundeſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters touching grace and predeſtination, thought it would be to the profite of the Church, if this doctrine ſo hard to the fleſh, for the weaker ſort that could not conceiue it, ſhould be omitted: and they added the example of other fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Auguſtine, whom they ſayd defended the Catholike faith no leſſe profitably many yeares without this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both againſt others, &amp; eſpecially againſt the Pelagians.

                     <p>And who wil ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe fathers and the vniuerſal Church did ſo confeſſe the grace of God, that they durſt deny his foreknowledge, which not only the learned, but alſo the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned confeſſe? Futher if they ſo knew that God gaue theſe things, as that they were not ignorant of his foreknowledge that he would giue, &amp; to whom he would giue: out of doubt they knew the predeſtination of the Saints. For this is nothing elſe, than the preſcience, and preparation of Gods benefites, whereby they are moſt certainely deliuered, as many as bee deliuered: the reſt being left by the iuſt iudgement of God in the lumpe of pedition.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly, as touching the maner and forme of teaching it,<note place="margin">The maner of teaching it, muſt be in apt and fit words.</note> we muſt take heede, that the things, which are ſpoken truely, be alſo aptly ſpoken, to auoide, as much as we may, the offence of the hearers. For it is greatly materiall, how, and after what maner of teaching anything is propounded. As for example, if any man ſpeaking of predeſtination vnto the Church, ſhould ſay, whether ye runne, or ſleepe, ye ſhall be that, that hee, who cannot bee deceiued, hath predeſtinated you vnto; predeſtination it ſelfe, ſeemeth to bee after a ſort diſproued by that preaching of it among the vnskilfull; as alſo the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God (which ſurely no man can deny) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be blamed, if it ſhould be ſaide to men, whether ye runne, or ſleepe, ye ſhall be that, for which he, who cannot be deceiued, hath foreknowne you. More fitly to this purpoſe it is ſaid: <hi>So runne ye, that ye may obtaine,</hi> and by your courſe know your ſelues to bee foreknowne, and to belong to the predeſtination of Gods grace. So it is too hard a ſaying, if a man ſhould ſpeake to the Chriſtian people after this ſorte: That ſome of you beleeue, others beleeue not, it therefore commeth to paſſe, becauſe ſome of you haue receiued the helpe of grace, pitying your miſerie, others haue not receiued it as yet. But if ye be elected, albeit not yet called, ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame grace. What neede is there of this ſpeech: <hi>Some of you?</hi> For if wee ſpeake to the Church of God, if wee ſpeake to the beleeuers, why ſay wee that ſome of them haue
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:8467:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
receiued grace, and ſo are ſuppoſed to doe wrong to the reſt? It may thus more fitly bee ſaide: thus the predeſtination of Gods will ſtandeth, that ye receiuing grace, are come from vnbeliefe to faith, and that not of your ſelues, it is the gift of God, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt. But if any of you walke as yet in your ſinnes, repent yee, awake, and riſe vp from the dead. Alſo, if any as yet bee not called, let vs pray for them, that they may be called: for peraduenture they be ſo elected, that they ſhall be graunted to our requeſts, and receiue with vs the ſame grace. Is not thus the ſame thing both more true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more fitly ſpoken? Of this matter our Auguſtine (whom I haue often cited) without controuerſie a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, learned,<note place="margin">De bono perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerant. cap. <hi>14.</hi>
                        </note> ſincere, and ſound, and a notable patron of the Catholike faith, (as Hilarie praiſeth him) hath written more at large. To him therefore let them reſorte, that deſire to know theſe things more exactly. And theſe things thus farre of the eternall predeſtination of God, who onely is wiſe, mercifull, and iuſt. To him be honor and bleſſing for euer and euer: Amen.</p>
